 is an art of record keeping and finding out the result thereof. 
Accounting is a systematic process of identifying, recording, measuring, classifying, 
summarizing and reporting of transactions with the aim of showing the financial status of 
a business unit. 
Let us understand this with the help of an example.
One morning you wake up to find your dad standing by your bedside and smiling at you. 
He pats you and wishes you Happy Birthday. Your dad then hands you Rs 2000. 
After that, you left for jogging. Then you come and have your breakfast. Right after you 
leave for tuition. After tuition you board an auto rickshaw and go to a multiplex. You pay 
Rs 50 to the auto driver and then buy movie tickets worth Rs 500. After movie, you take 
your friend out for lunch in a restaurant. You pay a bill of Rs 1000. You then ride back 
and again pay Rs 80 to the auto driver. 
So, you got Rs 2000 from your father and that is termed as Receipt. Therefore, receipt is 
something which you receive. 
From Rs 2000 you spent Rs 1630. This becomes your payments. So by payments we 
understand the money spent on events. 
So, the amount of money left with you is Rs 370. This money is your surplus.
